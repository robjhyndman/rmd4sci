Society Australia (SSA), and Melbourne Integrative Genomics (MIG) on November 12, 2018.

I'd like to first thank [Miles McBain](http://github.com/milesMcBain), for his working book, ["Git For Scientists"](https://milesmcbain.github.io/git_4_sci/index.html). This book inspired the structure and workflow of this existing book.

I'd also like to thank Karthik Ram, Yoav Ram, Martin Fenner, Puneet Kishor, and Jonathan Dugan, involved with the [Scholarly Markdown](http://scholmd.org/) site. This has helped inform some of the structure of this book. I'd also like to thank Patrick Robotham for his helpful discussions when first creating this book.
