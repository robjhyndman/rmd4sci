# Next Steps

So now you've got a handle on rmarkdown, what are some of the other things to think about learning? Here are some of my recommendations.

## Learn how to use git and github

git is a version control system. Not sure what a version control system is? No worries, let me explain. If you've ever named a document something like:

```
Final
Final 2
Really final
```

Or even if you have something like:

- `2018-10-10-document.Rmd`
- `2018-10-11-document.Rmd`

These are ways of managing which version you have
